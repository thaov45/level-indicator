# Temperature, Light, Audio sensor & 8 Level Indicator
Constructed 3 sensor circuits (temperature, light and sound) and a level indicator that lights up a number of LEDs based on the temperature / light / sound level (voltage of the signal).

- Each sensor circuit will have an indicator LED turned on when connected to the level indicator.
- Level indicator have 8 levels (zero LEDs turned on when the signal level is very low, all 8 LEDS turn on for maximum detectable level.)
(e.g. 0 LED = 0 sound, 8 LEDs for maximum sound level)
- Sensitivity is adjustable by using a single knob for each sensor circuit.
- Circuit will utilize +/- 4.5 V (or up to +/- 6 V) supply lines.  
- Sensors can be switched by moving 1 wire.
